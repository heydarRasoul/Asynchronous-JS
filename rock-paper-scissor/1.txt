1. Whiteboard all the possible variations for winning, losing, and draw. You might make a table to organize the results (like tables used to describe the result of two boolean expressions).

Player    	Computer	  Result
Rock	      Rock	      Draw
Rock	      Paper	      Lose
Rock	      Scissors   	Win
Paper     	Rock      	Win
Paper     	Paper     	Draw
Paper	      Scissors	  Lose
Scissors  	Rock	      Lose
Scissors	  Paper	      Win
Scissors	  Scissors  	Draw



2. Compare and contrast the Magic 8-ball assignment. What will be similar? What will be different?

Both the Magic 8-Ball in Python and Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript follow the same coding flow: input, process, and output. 
The Magic 8-Ball uses simple randomness with no logic checks, while Rock, Paper, Scissors requires conditional logic to determine 
a win, lose, or draw. Python's syntax is simpler and more forgiving, whereas JavaScript needs stricter syntax and type handling, 
but the core logic and structure are similar in both.
Rock, Paper, Scissors needs more control structures (if statements), which helps build deeper understanding of conditionals and program flow.
Rock, Paper, Scissors includes game rules, comparisons, and branching logic to determine the result.
Magic 8-Ball is purely random with no decision-making logic.
